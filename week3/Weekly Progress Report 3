Hi Doug
 
Here is the weekly progress report for the week gone by.
 
Company Challenge Question:
 
How might we make insurance truly personalized, integrated and easily accessible for younger consumers who may not understand the long-term financial and other benefits of these often complex products?
 
Week Behind:
 
1)      We worked on your inputs from the previous week and took your feedback to narrow down on a specific problem statements and have attempted to draw out a solution for the same. ( http://bit.ly/2cMIewx )
2)      The other ideas are being iterated upon and we are trying to figure out the feasibility of those products in the market.
3)      Created a Github repository and figured out a development process.( http://bit.ly/2cEFQfj )
4)      Our new Scrum master is Andrew who will be leading the Scrums in our team and representing us at the Scrum of Scrums.
5)      Listed out our individual and team goals. ( http://bit.ly/2d7gNSc )
 
Week ahead:
1)      Flesh out the idea tomorrow and present the idea during our first Sprint this Thursday.
2)      Explore feasibility of the idea and draft the product scope and outline.
3)      Figure out the roadmap and list the features for the MVP.
 
Risks:
 
The product might be existing in the market in a different format or is being worked    upon currently which we will research upon during the week.
 
I will update you on the developments here at CT after our first sprint.
 
Best Regards
